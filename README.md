# Image-processing-based-fire-detection-with-alarm-system

## Description

An image processing based fire detection system with alarm that switches on whenever fire is detected by the camera.

## How it Works

- The image processing used **HAAR cascade** algorithm to detect fire through the live webcam feed.
- A dataset containing positive and negative images is used and is trained using the **Cascade Trainer GUI**.
- The XML file generated by the GUI is then used in the detection of fire.
- A single value is sent continuously serially to where the Arduino is connected. Whenever fire is detected, based on the data received, the Arduino switches on/off the Alarm system.
